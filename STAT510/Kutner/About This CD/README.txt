                        Description of CDRom 

This compact disk contains the Student Solutions Manual in Adobe 
portable document (pdf) format and data files in ASCII format for the 
book:

      Applied Linear Regression Models, 4/E by Kutner, Nachtsheim, and 
      Neter, McGraw-Hill/Irwin c 2004.

All files on the compact disk can also be downloaded from the book's website:

The Student Solutions Manual is in the file named STUSOLNS.pdf.  The 
Student Solutions Manual provides intermediate and final numerical 
results for easy self-checking of solutions for selected problems. We use 
an asterisk (*) in front of the problem number to designate the problems 
for which the solutions appear in the Student Solutions Manual.

The compact disk also includes the data set files for all text examples, the 
data sets for the problems, exercises, projects, and case studies at the end 
of chapters, and the data sets in Appendix C.  The data in a data set are 
arranged in columns that are separated by spaces.  The ordering of the 
columns (variables) can be readily ascertained from the tabular display of 
the data set in the text since the text always provides the data for at least 
the initial and final cases.

Data sets have names in one of the following formats, depending on 
whether the data pertain to a problem, a table, a figure, or an appendix (xx 
denotes the number):

CHxxPRxx	For data sets from end-of-chapter problems, exercises, and 
                projects. 
Example:        CH04PR12 denotes the data set for Problem 4.12 in Chapter 4.

ChxxTAxx	For data sets from text tables.
Example:        CH12TA02 denotes the data set for Table 12.2 in Chapter 12.

ChxxFIxx	For data sets from text figures.
Example:        CH06FI05 denotes the data set for Figure 6.5 in Chapter 6.

APPENCxx	For data sets from Appendix C.
Example:        APPENC09 denotes the data set in Appendix C.9.

All data set file names are followed by the extension .TXT, indicating that 
the file is a text file.
